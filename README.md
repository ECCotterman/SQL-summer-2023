## From the Project Brief: 

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world... Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service... Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

## Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:
##### ● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
##### ● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
##### ● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
##### ● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
##### ● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Project Deliverables
At the end of each Exercise, you’ll complete a task and submit a deliverable that directly contributes to your final project—in this case, an analysis that answers business questions put forward by the management team.

## Final Analysis Criteria
Your final project will be evaluated on your ability to:
##### ● Write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.
##### ● Present your SQL results to business managers by creating visualizations and telling a compelling story.
##### ● Present your SQL results to your technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a data dictionary.
##### ● Create a professional project that you can add to your portfolio and show to employers.
